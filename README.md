# Next Generation Regtech 
> ## How the next generation of AML/KYC technologies is driving regulatory compliance in Financial Institutions.
### Introduction: The Birth and Growth of Regtech
The Global Financial Crisis **(GFC)** had a deep impact on the global financial system as it deepened the already lack of trust in traditional financial institutions, accelerating the adoption of new technologies, entrant of new players (i.e. technology firms) and growth in challenger banks. Additionally the exposed vulnerabilities of our financial system to asset bubbles and knock-on effects generated a myriad of regulations looking to protect consumers from potential systemic losses in too big too fail financial institutions.

People trust technology firms more than banks. A multi-country survey by Bain Research of **151,894** consumers in **29** countries showed that on average **54%** of respondents trust at least one tech company more than banks in general [1]. This distrust was fueled by the GFC and capitalized by fintech companies who have seen investments growing substantively. In fact, since 2010 global investment in fintech has increased from an average **U$S 6.3 billion** for the 2010-2012 period to **U$S 99.43 billion** for the 2017-2019 period, a fifteenfold increase [2]. And while COVID19 affected the capital flowing to these type of companies Q2 2020 saw a all-time record in the number of mega-round (i.e. U$S100M+) investments [3]. 

This rising trend in fintech investment has also been reflected in the Regtech industry. Regtech is traditionaly defined as ‘technological solutions that streamline and improve the regulatory process’[4]. A research report by BBVA suggest that financial institutions dedicate approximately 10% to 15% of their workforce to governance, risk management and compliance[5]. These costs, which for tier one banks amount over U$S 1 billion per year, are spent to try to avoid the massive fines to which the industry is subject to for non-compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations among others. While estimates for the fines issued for the 2009-2019 decade vary, the projected amount of fines by Q4 2020 is expected to reach U$S 400 billion. However, the recent leaked documents from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) describing over 200,000 dubious financial operations from the 1999 to the 2017 [6] across multiple global financial institutions suggest that we could expect these fines to increase substantively.  

The financial industry has been applying regtech of some sort since the early beginnings of the public securities market as it was important to detect atypical transactions and market behavior (e.g. insider trading). Ultimately the GFC, cybercrimes and ability to develop Ponzi schemes through the use of technology has triggered a massive increase in prudential, supervisory and consumer protection regulations that ‘compared to pre-financial crisis spending levels, increased operating costs spent on compliance by over 60 percent for retail and corporate banks’[7].  

AI, block-chain and deep learning technologies have the potential to automate consumer protection, market supervision and prudential regulation [8] saving the industry billions in costs and fines. As our financial systems migrate towards the digitalization of money and new forms of currencies the Regtech industry will play a key role in the appropriate development of financial markets and ensuring that the financial systems delivers on our societal and development needs for an inclusive and more equitable future. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> 

### Simplifying Compliance and Fraud Prevention: Overview and Origin of Alessa, a noble defender.

Formerly known as CaseWare RCM, Alessa, a word that traces its roots from the ancient Greek meaning ‘noble defender’  or ‘protector of the people’[10] is a ‘a continuous controls and financial crimes risk management solution that allows organizations to quickly identify suspicious activities and high-risk entities in compliance, finance, purchasing and procurement programs’[11]. 

CaseWare RCM founded by Dwight Wainman was initially incorporated in 1988 and rebranded its continuous controls monitoring and anti-money laundering (AML) solution as Alessa in  2019[12].  

With its operation on continuous controls monitoring and anti-money laundering starting in 2010 and with the growth of the business, CaseWare Partners decided in 2019 that with the growth of ‘CaseWare Monitor’ its flagship product it was time to rename the product ‘to reflect the true value that it provides to its customers’[13].  

Alessa currently has between 51-200 employees [14] and offers a variety of features to prevent money laundering, breaches in internal controls, purchase card (p-card) abuse, travel and entertainment (T&E) expenses fraud, and insurance fraud [15].
