# Next Generation Regtech 
> ## How the next generation of AML/KYC technologies is driving regulatory compliance in Financial Institutions.
### Introduction: The Birth and Growth of Regtech
The Global Financial Crisis **(GFC)** had a deep impact on the global financial system as it deepened the already lack of trust in traditional financial institutions, accelerating the adoption of new technologies, entrant of new players (i.e. technology firms) and growth in challenger banks. Additionally the exposed vulnerabilities of our financial system to asset bubbles and knock-on effects generated a myriad of regulations looking to protect consumers from potential systemic losses in too big too fail financial institutions.

People trust technology firms more than banks. A multi-country survey by Bain Research of **151,894** consumers in **29** countries showed that on average **54%** of respondents trust at least one tech company more than banks in general [1]. This distrust was fueled by the GFC and capitalized by fintech companies who have seen investments growing substantively. In fact, since 2010 global investment in fintech has increased from an average **U$S 6.3 billion** for the 2010-2012 period to **U$S 99.43 billion** for the 2017-2019 period, a fifteenfold increase [2]. And while COVID19 affected the capital flowing to these type of companies Q2 2020 saw a all-time record in the number of mega-round (i.e. U$S100M+) investments [3]. 

This rising trend in fintech investment has also been reflected in the Regtech industry. Regtech is traditionaly defined as ‘technological solutions that streamline and improve the regulatory process’[4]. A research report by BBVA suggest that financial institutions dedicate approximately 10% to 15% of their workforce to governance, risk management and compliance[5]. These costs, which for tier one banks amount over U$S 1 billion per year, are spent to try to avoid the massive fines to which the industry is subject to for non-compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations among others. While estimates for the fines issued for the 2009-2019 decade vary, the projected amount of fines by Q4 2020 is expected to reach U$S 400 billion. However, the recent leaked documents from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) describing over 200,000 dubious financial operations from the 1999 to the 2017 [6] across multiple global financial institutions suggest that we could expect these fines to increase substantively.  

The financial industry has been applying regtech of some sort since the early beginnings of the public securities market as it was important to detect atypical transactions and market behavior (e.g. insider trading). Ultimately the GFC, cybercrimes and ability to develop Ponzi schemes through the use of technology has triggered a massive increase in prudential, supervisory and consumer protection regulations that ‘compared to pre-financial crisis spending levels, increased operating costs spent on compliance by over 60 percent for retail and corporate banks’[7].  

AI, block-chain and deep learning technologies have the potential to automate consumer protection, market supervision and prudential regulation [8] saving the industry billions in costs and fines. As our financial systems migrate towards the digitalization of money and new forms of currencies the Regtech industry will play a key role in the appropriate development of financial markets and ensuring that the financial systems delivers on our societal and development needs for an inclusive and more equitable future. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> 

### Simplifying Compliance and Fraud Prevention: Overview and Origin of Alessa, a noble defender.

Formerly known as CaseWare RCM, Alessa, a word that traces its roots from the ancient Greek meaning ‘noble defender’  or ‘protector of the people’[10] is a ‘a continuous controls and financial crimes risk management solution that allows organizations to quickly identify suspicious activities and high-risk entities in compliance, finance, purchasing and procurement programs’[11]. 

CaseWare RCM founded by Dwight Wainman was initially incorporated in 1988 and rebranded its continuous controls monitoring and anti-money laundering (AML) solution as Alessa in  2019[12].  

With its operation on continuous controls monitoring and anti-money laundering starting in 2010 and with the growth of the business, CaseWare Partners decided in 2019 that with the growth of ‘CaseWare Monitor’ its flagship product it was time to rename the product ‘to reflect the true value that it provides to its customers’[13].  

Alessa currently has between 51-200 employees [14] and offers a variety of features to prevent money laundering, breaches in internal controls, purchase card (p-card) abuse, travel and entertainment (T&E) expenses fraud, and insurance fraud [15].  

### A technology to fight financial crimes and protect the customer:

Alessa’s flagship product is Alessa (formerly Caseware Monitor). It is used in +20 countries mainly by companies in the financial industry but also other industries (i.e. gamming)in the need to identify high-risk entities and transactions in order to prevent potential frauds. 

> ### One Product; Multiple Solutions

As a product Alessa caters to different needs within the financial industry:

- **AML Compliance:** Alessa uses API’s allows for better integration with financial institutions onboarding systems to verify identities and search sanctions, politically exposed persons (PEPs), Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Sanctions, and proprietary lists in real time.[16] 
It monitor every financial activity and uses big-data to create a multi-variate and customizable risk score to match the client’s risk appetite and tolerance. The software will not only flag potential issues but allow for collaborative case management and investigation.[17]   
Last but not least it offers automated regulatory reporting to regulators, including FinCEN, FINTRAC and jurisdictions using go AML.

- **Sanctions Screening:** Alessa’s sanction screening solutions allow clients to screen clients regularly (including PEPs), investigate and remediate any potential suspicious relationships, and finally automate the reporting of suspicious activities.[18] It does so by AI-based comparisons using natural language processing (NLP) techniques including neural networks, Markov models, transliteration rules, and word embedding vectors.[19]  

- **Transaction Monitoring:** Alessa accesses and assesses transactions in real time (i.e. when a bank initiates a wire transfer) or in batches as determined by the user who can also customize (i.e. determine the adequate workflow)how to proceed (i.e. block, investigate, record, etc.)in case a high-risk transaction is detected. Transaction monitoring can be also used in the insurance industry to identify potentially fraudulent insurance claims in real-time.[20] 

- **Fraud Detection and Prevention:** Alessa allows organizations to screen all customers in real time to detect suspicious activities thereby reducing the costs of recovery services. 

- **Continuous Control Monitoring (CCM):** Alessa serves not only as a client facing solution but also allows continuous monitoring and auditing of internal business processes (e.g. monitoring corporate purchases or credit card transactions, compliance with tax regulation, etc.).CCM solution apply to a wide array of a company’s operations monitoring such as [21]:
>>- Purchase Card Monitoring
>>- Tax compliance Monitoring
>>- Customs Compliance Monitoring
>>- Retail Monitoring
>>- Purchase to Pay (P2P)
>>- Payroll Monitoring

- **Procurement Monitoring:** A detailed solution offered to monitor and detect fraud to prevent revenue loss, abuse and waste in expense and procurement programs.[22] This specific inward facing platform allows to monitor and take action on:
>>-	Purchasing card monitoring
>>-	Travel and entertainment expenses monitoring
>>-	Anti-bribery, anti-corruption
>>-	Vendor risk management
>>-	Materials management

### The Regtech Landscape and its Evolution 

Regtech solutions not only offer great internal cost saving opportunities by automating compliance and regulatory reporting processes through the use of technology, but also prevent potential fines through real-time monitoring of transactions and the use of other technologies such as NLP, AI, Deep learning and others to identify potential money laundering and fraud schemes.

As previously mentioned, compliance costs increased by over 60% compared to pre-financial crisis spending levels. 2025 forecasts on the growth of the global regtech market size vary from U$S 16 billion [23] to U$S 55 billion [24] by 2025 with respective expansions of 20% CARG to 52% CAGR. 

This growth is not only driven by the increasing number of regulations in the financial industry but also by the increasing numbers of fraudulent activities that a digital economy has enabled. 

The Regtech market is usually breakdown in the following categories:
- Risk & Compliance Management
- Identity Management
- Regulatory Reporting
- Fraud Management
- Regulatory Intelligence

There have been several innovations in the market over the last couple of years that are worth high-lighting:

- Real-time Reporting
- Biometric authentication
- Blockchain
- Quantum computing

Many of the innovations in the reg-tech space have been advance by traditional market players and many others by new entrants. Deloitte has mapped more than 370 regtech companies across the five identified categories. Some of the most recognized companies in the market today are [25]:

### From CaseWare RCM to Alessa: A Growth History
Disruptive innovation has been part of Caseware’s DNA since its beginnings aiming to develop cutting-edge software solutions for audit, financial reporting and data analytics.[26] Founded in 1988 in Toronto, CaseWare has growth through a combination of the development of new products (e.g. Caseware Time (1991), Caseware IDEA (2000) and acquisitions (e.g. Credence Software (2010), Symsure (2010). In 2019 Caseware RCM rebranded as Alessa.

Since its early beginnings Alessa was highlighted as one of the most promising compliance solution providers, later expanding its services to all AML compliance tools in one platform, case management capacities and reporting capabilities.
 
The product offering from Alessa kept expanding throughout the years to integrate in one single platform a multiple set of solutions to allow customers to meet regulatory reporting requirements easily while reducing the cost of compliance. It also expanded its functionalities to integrate API’s and technology to allow its customers to verify identity, screen customers and gauge risk scores in real-time during customer due diligence phase.[27] 
Alessa’s later integrated its solutions with Thomson Reuter CLEAR ID solution and with Refinitiv to enhance the value of its products.  

### The Future of Alessa: Recommendations for a Fast Evolving Landscape

The fintech ecosystem is one of the fastest evolving and growing entrepreneurial ecosystems. The financial industry (and system) with its recurring crisis, legacy outdated and inefficient technologies and trust issues from its main stakeholders -its clients- was ripe for disruption and the GFC was an excellent catalyst. 
As in many other industries, early on market innovations usually benefit from regulatory loopholes which allow companies to grow and benefit from the ‘burdens and costs’ of regulations. And while some could argue that regulation stifles growth it can, if developed appropriately, help markets grow in a more orderly fashion while preventing the use of technologies for the wrong purpose. In the case of fintech, digital currencies and cryptocurrencies offer an immense potential for effective monetary policy deployment by central banks or targeted stimulus. However, as it has been experienced (e.g. silk-road) they can also be used to finance illicit activities. 
As fintech continues to evolve Alessa will certainly need to look into developing solutions in two areas:
- Tracking, Identifying and Real Time monitoring of crypto-asset transactions.
- Regulation of global fintech companies.
